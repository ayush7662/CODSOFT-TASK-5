 Credit Card Fraud Detection

# Description
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a small percentage of transactions being fraudulent.

# Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- 
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `creditcard.csv`, which should be placed in the project directory. This dataset contains the following columns:
- V1, V2, ..., V28: Features generated by Principal Component Analysis to protect user identities and sensitive information.
  Time: The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- Amount: The transaction amount.
- Class: The target variable, where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a legitimate transaction.

# Usage
1. Ensure that the `creditcard.csv` file is in the project directory.
2. Run the `creditcardfrauddetection.py` script to see the predictions and visualizations.
